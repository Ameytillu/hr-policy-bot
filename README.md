### SmartHR Copilot (Streamlit + OpenAI API)

SmartHR Copilot is an AI-powered HR assistant built with Streamlit that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and the OpenAI API to answer company HR policy questions with accuracy, citations, and a personal touch.

It’s designed to make internal HR communication effortless — helping employees instantly check policies, understand benefits, or get leave-related answers without emailing HR.
The project is evolving to include features like checking leave balances, applying for leave, and accessing personalized HR data through natural conversations.
